# SauceDemo QA Project

This repository demonstrates a structured and systematic QA approach to software quality assurance (QA) for the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce web application. The project applies structured testing practices following the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) to ensure clarity and traceability, and is designed with future automation in mind.

---

## Project Overview
- **Application:** E-commerce Web Application
- **Target Website:** https://www.saucedemo.com/
- **Application Owner:** Sauce Labs
- **Testing Scope:** Functional Web Testing (UI, business logic, session management)

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Apply software testing fundamentals using a systematic and process-oriented mindset
- Analyze system behavior to derive and document requirements
- Design robust, maintainable test cases for positive, negative, and edge scenarios
- Execute tests systematically and document results clearly
- Report and manage defects with actionable detail for development teams

---

## Module Coverage
- **Authentication** – User login & validation
- **Product** – Product listing & sorting
- **Cart** – Cart operations & validation
- **Checkout** – Form validation & order completion

---

## ✅ In Scope
- Functional UI testing
- Negative testing
- Boundary value analysis
- Validation & error message verification

## 🚫 Out of Scope
- Performance testing
- API testing
- Security testing
- Load / stress testing

---

## 🛠️ Testing Process (STLC)

1️⃣ **Requirements Analysis & Review**
- Observe and model system behavior
- Write User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
- Develop a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) for coverage mapping

2️⃣ **Test Case Design**
- Define Test Scenarios for comprehensive coverage
- Author Test Cases with clear steps, data, and expected outcomes
- Ensure test cases are modular and reusable

3️⃣ **Test Execution & Traceability**
- Execute tests systematically and log results for traceability
- Use version control and documentation for reproducibility

4️⃣ **Defect Reporting & Management**
- Report defects with detailed steps, logs, and environment information
- Document and communicate defects with sufficient detail for resolution

---

## Best Practices
- Design test cases for clarity, maintainability, and scalability
- Ensure coverage of positive, negative, and edge cases
- Maintain strong traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects
- Provide actionable, reproducible defect reports
- Write test cases in a structured format that can be adapted for automation in the future
